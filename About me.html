    <h1>About me</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Hi, I’m Navale Lokesh, a Computer Science and Engineering student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML). I have a strong passion for technology and creativity, with skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, which I use to build modern and responsive websites.

I enjoy coding, web development, and learning new technologies, and I’m constantly exploring innovative ways to solve problems through software. Apart from academics, I like listening to music, riding bikes, watching movies, and writing blogs such as my ongoing mystery thriller series The Blue Pill Murders.

My goal is to grow as a skilled software developer and contribute to impactful projects that combine technology with real-world solutions.</p>
